Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0: think: I got derailed by issuing invalid/garbled commands and never executed the required object-specific actions; next time I should immediately locate the target object and the required tool/container, then perform the exact verb sequence (go to the right surface, open if needed, take the item, then do the task action like heat/cool/clean/use/put) without repeating “look”/nonsense inputs, and if an action yields “Nothing happens” I should switch to the next plausible location (countertops/drawers/shelves/desks) and continue systematically.

Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0: think: Plan: I wasted all my steps by typing irrelevant “nothing happens” instead of interacting with objects.
